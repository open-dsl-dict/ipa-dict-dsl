# ipa-dict-dsl - IPA Dictionaries in DSL format

This repository makes available a collection of IPA dictionaries in DSL format derived from the [IPA Dictionary](https://github.com/open-dict-data/ipa-dict) project. This makes it easy to look up the IPA pronunciation of words in a variety of languages using your favourite dictionary program.

## Format

ABBYY Lingvo DSL is a flexible dictionary format that can be read by dictionary applications such as [Goldendict](https://github.com/goldendict/goldendict) and converted to other formats using tools such as [pyglossary](https://github.com/ilius/pyglossary). There are also a number of tools for creating DSL format dictionaries available in the [dsl-tools](https://github.com/dohliam/dsl-tools) project.

DSL files *must* be saved as UTF-16 to be usable by dictionary programs. The raw source files in this repository are saved in UTF-8 format, which is both significantly smaller in terms of file size, and also readable (and diffable) by git. However, there are fully encoded and compressed `.dsl.dz` dictionaries ready for use available in the [Releases](https://github.com/open-dsl-dict/ipa-dict-dsl/releases) section.

You can also use the `rezip_dsl.rb` and `unzip_dsl.rb` [scripts](https://github.com/dohliam/dsl-tools/tree/master/zip_unzip) provided by the [dsl-tools](https://github.com/dohliam/dsl-tools) repo to encode/compress and decode/uncompress the dictionaries yourself either individually or as a group.

## Data
